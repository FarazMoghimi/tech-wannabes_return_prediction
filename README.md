Tech Wannabes? Mimicking Labor Skill Composition and Predictable Returns  

Over the past decade, traditional non-tech companies have sought and harnessed the power of various emerging technology (such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing) in an effort to gain a foothold in the technology space alongside their big tech peers. We dub this as a tech-wannabe phenomenon. In this paper, we investigate the asset pricing implications of the tech-wannabe phenomenon. Specifically, we examine whether and how future stock performance can be predicted by firms’ pursuit of a more tech-oriented labor pool; arguably, a key corporate production input that underpins the tech-wannabe phenomenon. For this task, we utilize a novel approach by dynamically leveraging the proximity of firm demanded skill composition to that of “big tech” companies. Overall, we find a statistically significant, and economically large positive association between TW and future risk adjusted returns and profits. Conducting various asset pricing tests, we demonstrate that our results are robust, and mostly consistent with a mixture of “low attention”, and “limits to arbitrage” explanations .
