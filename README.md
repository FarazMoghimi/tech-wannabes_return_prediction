Tech Wannabes? 
Mimicking Labor Skill Composition and Predictable Returns  

Abstract
“Every Company Wants to Become a Tech Company”—we dub this as the tech wannabe phenomenon, which is underpinned by the firm’s pursuit of a tech-oriented labor pool for product development and digital transformation. To quantify a focal firm’s (i.e., a potential tech wannabe) technology transformation efforts, we derive a novel measure, TW, to assess the similarity of job skill demand by the firm and tech giants (i.e., tech benchmarks). We find that TW is positively associated with the focal firm’s future stock returns; and such return predictability is primarily driven by its mimicking tech hiring. Our results highlight the value-relevance of firms’ tech skill demand, and are broadly consistent with sluggish price adjustment likely due to investors’ inattention to disclosures made through the human-resources channel.
